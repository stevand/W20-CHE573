This can be seen as follows:\n    By definition, a DT sinusoid is periodic if and only if there exists an integer $N>0$ such that\n    \n    $$x(n+N)=x(n) \\quad \\;\\text{for all}\\; n$$\n    \n    Let us calculate $x(n+N)$ and $x(n)$ separately and see what we get.\n    \n    $$\\begin{array}{rcl} x(n+N)&=&A\\cos[2\\pi f(n+N) +\\theta]\\\\&=&A\\cos(2\\pi fn + \\theta + 2\\pi fN)\\\\    x(n) &=& A\\cos(2\\pi fn +\\theta)    \\end{array}$$\n    \n    In order to have $x(n)=x(n+N)$, there must exist an integer $k$ such that:\n    \n    $$2\\pi fN = 2\\pi k$$\n    \n    or, equivalently,\n    \n    $$  f = \\dfrac{k}{N}$$\n    \n    According to above equation, a discrete-time sinusoidal signal is periodic only if its frequency $f$ can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. This is, $f$ is rational. The smallest $N$ such that above expression holds is called the **fundamental period**.\n    \n    **Remark**\n    \n    From the above discussion, it can be concluded that not all DT sinusoids are periodic. To determine the fundamental period $N$ of a DT periodic sinusoid, we can express its frequency $f$ and cancel the common factors so that $k$ and $N$ are relatively prime. Then, the fundamental period of the sinusoid is equal to $N$.\n    \n    **Example**:\n    Consider two DT sinusoids with frequencies $f_1=30/60$ and $f_2=31/60$, respectively. It can be found that the fundamental periods of the two signals are $N_1=2$ and $N_2=60$. From this example, it can be seen that a small change in frequency can result in a large change in the period.\n\n-   **Discrete-time sinusoids whose frequencies are separated by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ are identical.**\n    \n    To prove this statement, let us consider the following sinusoids:\n    \n    $$\\begin{array}{rcl}x_1(n) & = & A\\cos(w_1n +\\theta)\\\\x_2(n) & = & A\\cos(w_2n +\\theta)\\end{array}$$\n    \n    where $-\\pi\\leq w_1\\leq \\pi$ and $w_2=w_1 + 2\\pi k$ with $k$ an integer. It can be seen that:\n    \n    $$\\begin{array}{rcl}x_2(n) & = & A\\cos(w_2n +\\theta) = A\\cos[(w_1+2\\pi k)n + \\theta]\\\\&=& A\\cos(w_1n + \\theta + 2\\pi kn) = A\\cos(w_1n + \\theta)\\\\&=& x_1(n) \\end{array}$$\n    \n    **Remark**\n    \n    The above property is due to the fact that the sampling number $n$ takes integer values which ensures that $2\\pi kn$ is always a value of integer multiple of $2\\pi$. This is an important difference between DT sinusoids and CT sinusoids.\n    \n    In terms of $f$, the above property can be stated as follows: {\\em discrete-time sinusoids whose frequencies are separated by an integer (such that $f_2=f_1+k$) are identical.}\n\n-   **Any signal resulting from a DT sinusoidal signal with $|w|>\\pi$ or $|f|>\\dfrac{1}{2}$ is identical to a signal obtained with $|w|<\\pi$ or $|f|<\\dfrac{1}{2}$.**\n    \n    This property is a result of the previous property. This property is based on the observation that any  frequency $w$ (or frequency $f$) can be represented as the sum of an  frequency $w_0$ (or a frequency $f_0$) between $-\\pi$ (or -1/2) and $\\pi$ (or 1/2) and an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ (or an integer). That is,\n    \n    $$ w = w_0 + 2\\pi k \\quad \\;or\\; \\quad f=f_0+k $$\n    \n    where $-\\pi\\leq w_0\\leq \\pi$ and $-1/2\\leq f_0\\leq 1/2$.\n    \n    **Example:**\n    Some examples,\n    \n    $$\\begin{array}{c}w = \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3} = -\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}+2\\pi,\\;w=\\dfrac{8\\pi}{3} = \\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}+2\\pi\\\\ f = 1.1 = 0.1 + 1,\\; f = 9.6 = -0.4 + 10 \\end{array}$$\n    \n    Because of this similarity, we call DT sinusoid having the  frequency $|w|>\\pi$ (or $|f|>1/2$) an **alias** of the corresponding signal with $|w|<\\pi$ (or $|f|<1/2$).\n    \n    **Example**\n    \n    $x_1(n)$ is an alias of $x_2(n)$\n    \n    $$\\begin{array}{rcl}x_1(n) & = & A\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{7}{6}\\pi n +\\theta\\right)=A\\cos\\left[\\left(-\\dfrac{5}{6}\\pi + 2\\pi\\right)n + \\theta\\right]\\\\ x_2(n) & = & A\\cos\\left(-\\dfrac{5}{6}\\pi n + \\theta\\right)\\end{array}$$\n    \n    Thus, we regard frequencies in the range $-\\pi\\leq w\\leq \\pi$ or $-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\leq f\\leq \\dfrac{1}{2}$ as unique and all frequencies $|w|> \\pi$ or $|f|> \\dfrac{1}{2}$ as aliases. Further, we define:\n    \n    $$-\\pi\\leq w\\leq \\pi \\quad \\;or\\;\\quad -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\leq f\\leq \\dfrac{1}{2}$$\n    \n    as the **fundamental frequency range** of discrete-time sinusoids.\n\n-   **The highest rate of oscillation in a DT sinusoid is attained when $w=\\pm\\pi$ or $f=\\pm\\dfrac{1}{2}$.**\n    This property is a straightforward result of the previous property. When $f$ increase from 0 to 1/2, oscillation rate increases; when $f$ decreases from 0 to -1/2, oscillation rate increases.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"fig3"}],"source":["%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\nA=1\nf=1./math.sqrt(17)\nomega=2*math.pi*f\n\nt=np.linspace(-15,15,31)\nx=A*np.sin(omega*t)\n\nplt.xlabel('n')\nplt.ylabel('$x_d(n)$')\nplt.plot(t,x,'bo-',t,np.zeros(len(t)),'-')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["| **Continuous-time Sinusoids**|**Discrete-time Sinusoids**|\n|---|---|\n| $x_c(t)=A\\cos(\\Omega t+\\theta)=A\\cos(2\\pi F t+\\theta)$|$x_d(n)=A\\cos(wn+\\theta)=A\\cos(2\\pi fn+\\theta)$|\n| $\\Omega=2\\pi F$|$w=2\\pi f$|\n| Periodic for any $\\Omega$ or $F$|Periodic for rational $f$|\n| Fundamental period $T_p=\\dfrac{1}{F}$|Fundamental period is the smallest $N$ such that $fN=k$ where $k$ is an integer|\n| $-\\infty<F<\\infty$, $-\\infty<\\Omega<\\infty$|$-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\leq f\\leq\\dfrac{1}{2}$, $-\\pi \\leq w\\leq\\pi$|\n| When $F$ increases from 0 to $\\infty$, oscillation rate increases;|When $f$ increases from 0 to $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ oscillation rate increases;|\n| when $F$ decreases from 0 to $-\\infty$, oscillation rate decreases|when $f$ decreases from 0 to $-\\dfrac{1}{2}$, oscillation rate increases|\n| ||\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Summary\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   We introduce signals continuous and discrete sinusoidal signals\n    -   Properties of discrete and continuous signals are explored\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Followup actions\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   Run the python code and change parameters in the signal generation to obtain periodic and non periodic signals\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{"KEYWORDS":"Frequency concept, periodic signals"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

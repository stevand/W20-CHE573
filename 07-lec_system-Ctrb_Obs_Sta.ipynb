This is a very efficient approach to check the stability of an LTI system. The result is illustrated in the following graph.\n\n![img](./FiguresCHE573/stability_radius2.png \"Stability radius\")\n\nIn CHE 446 Process Control, we learned that for continuous-time systems, if the poles of the Laplace transfer function of a system are on the left half plane of the complex $s$-plane, the system is stable. The difference between the results for continuous-time system and discrete-time systems actually can be explained by studying the relation between Laplace transform and $z$-transform.\n\nLet us recall the definition for Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of a continuous-time signal $x_c(t)$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$X_c(s) = \\int_{t=0}^{t=\\infty}x_c(t)e^{-st}dt$$\n\nThe $z$-transform of a discrete-time signal $x(n)$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x(n)z^{-n}$$\n\nLet us also consider that $x(n)$ is the sampled signal of $x_c(t)$ with the sampling time $T$. Then,\n\n$$x(n)=x_c(nT)$$\n\nSubstituting this discretization time back to, we can have:\n\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x_c(nT)z^{-n}$$\n\nBy comparing above equations, it can be seen that:\n\n$$X(z) = X_c(s)|_{t=nT}$$\n\nwith\n\n$$z=e^{sT}$$\n\nwe can interpret $z$-transform as the sampled Laplace transform with $z=e^{sT}$.\n\nLet us consider an area on the left half of the $s$-plane as shown in the following graph. The area is with the boundary $A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow C'\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E'\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow A$. In the graph, $w_s=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{T}$ where $T$ is the sampling time. The points on the boundary are mapped to the $z$-plane as follows:\n\n-   Point A: $s=0$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{T\\cdot 0}=1$\n-   Point B: $s=i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{T\\cdot s}=\\cos(\\dfrac{Tw_s}{2})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{Tw_s}{2})=\\cos(\\pi)+i\\sin(\\pi)=-1$\n-   Point C: $s=-\\alpha+i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point C': $s=-\\alpha+i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{4}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{-T\\alpha}(\\cos(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}))=i\\cdot e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point D: $s=-\\alpha$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point E': $s=-\\alpha-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{4}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-i\\cdot e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point E: $s=-\\alpha-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point F: $s=-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-1$\n\nIt can be seen that the area in the $s$-plane is mapped into an annulus with outside radius $r_o=1$ and inside radius $r_i=e^{-T\\alpha}$. Similar analysis can be applied to other areas. What we should find is that the left half of the $s$-plane is mapped to the inside of the unit circle. This explains why in the discrete-time domain, the stability condition is poles are within the unit circle.\n\n![img](./FiguresCHE573/output-onlinepngtools-2.png \"Stability radius\")\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Controllability\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   The question to be answered when it comse to the controlalbility of the system is: *Can we find the input function* *(u(t)\\\\) /such that the system is transfered from initial state* $x(0)$ *to arbitrary desired state in finite time?*\n    -   In the oil industry large interconnections of the tank and vessel systems are used for the storage and inventory management. We are interested if we can use the input $u(k)$ to drive oil to the tanker. The answer is given by answering whether the system (tanks and vessels) is controllable from the input $u(k)$, or in other words, is there any input that can drive the system state to a desired point in the finite time. Practically, we want to provide an input $u(k)$ such that the tank  height  (T9) is at a certain level which will provide the pressure  gradient  based force to fill the tanker (see the figure in the notes).\n    \n    -   **Controllability** is an important system's theoretic property. The controllability in a layman's language answers as to whether the system can be controlled. Let us look at the discrete state space description, given as:\n        \n        $${{x}(k+1)}=A x(k)+B u(k)\\\\y(k)=Cx(k)+Du(k)$$\n        \n        the system is controllable if $x(0)$ can be transferred to a final state $x^{*}$ in the finite time $t=nT$ regardless of $x(0)$. Therefore, if the system is controllable, there exists some $u(t)=u(nT)=u(n)$ such that the system will be transferred from some arbitrary initial state by the input $u(k)$ to some final state in the finite time. The controllability is usualy defined (to the origin) and reachability (from the origin). Therefore, we want to transfer $x(0)\\rightarrow x^*=x(N)$ by the application of the set of inputs given as:\n        $$\\left\\{u(0),u(1),u(2),u(3),\\cdots,u(k),\\cdots,u(N-1)\\right\\}$$\n        \n        Hence, we are interested in the existence of the $u(k)$ that will transfer the system and we provide a definition to check controllability (Pontrygin).\n        \n        **Controllability (Def. by Pontrygin**: *\\`\\`The system is controllable if and only if the rank of matrix*\n        $$rank\\left[ B\\; AB\\;A^2B\\;\\cdots A^{N-1}B\\right]=n$$\n        *where $n$ is the size of matrix A*\n        \n        Let us construct the sequence of control moves\n        $$\\left\\{u(0),u(1),u(2),u(3),\\cdots,u(k),\\cdots,u(N-1)\\right\\}$$\n        which transfer the system from $x(0)\\rightarrow x(N)=x^*$,\n        \n        $$\\begin{array}x(0)&&\\nonumber\\\\x(1)&=&Ax(0)+Bu(0)\\nonumber\\\\x(2)&=&A^2x(0)+ABu(0)+Bu(1)\\nonumber\\\\x(3)&=&A^3x(0)+A^2Bu(0)+ABu(1)+Bu(2)\\nonumber\\\\\\cdots&=&\\cdots\\nonumber\\\\x^*=x(N)&=&A^Nx(0)+A^{N-1}Bu(0)+A^{N-2}Bu(1)+\\cdots+ABu(N-2)+Bu(N-1)\\end{array}$$\n\n  Now, let us rewrite the last expression such that the initial condition contribution is on the left side of the equation, therefore we\nget\n\n$$x^*-A^Nx(0)=\\left[B\\;AB\\;A^2B\\cdots A^{N-1}B\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}u(N-1)\\\\u(N-2)\\\\u(N-3)\\\\\\cdots\\\\u(1)\\\\u(0)\\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nGiven the vector $x^*$, $A$ and $x(0)$, these are two vectors in $R^n$, and  $A^n\\in n \\times n$, so the result of $\\bar{x}=x^*-A^Nx(0)$ must be in the range of the matrix $C_{trb}$. We know that the system of equations $C_{trb}\\textbf{u}=\\bar{x}$ has a solution only if $C_{trb}$ is invertible, which implies that the columns of $C_{trb}$ must have $n$-independent vectors. Therefore,\n$$rank\\left[B\\;AB\\;A^2B\\cdots A^{n-1}B\\right]=n$$\n\nThe range of matrix\n$$C_{trb}=\\left[B\\;AB\\;A^2B\\cdots A^{n-1}B\\right] $$\nis called *controllable subspace*. Naturally, from the above equation we observe that small increments of state trajectories must be independent, otherwise the path is the function of direction, see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvTm6qRtffM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvTm6qRtffM).\n\nFinally, we list the following three useful complementary criteria to check controllability of the system.\n\nControllability conditions}}: The system is controllable if one of these three equivalent conditions holds:\n\n-   rank $[B \\;AB\\;A^2B\\cdots A^{n-1}B]=n$ where $n$ is the size of $A$-matrix\n-   rank $[\\lambda I-A |B]=n$, $\\forall$ $\\lambda$ eigenvalue of matrix $A$,  $$lambda  \\in C$-complex plane\n-   rank $W_n=n$\n\nWe notice in the second condition when the $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$ the rank will be less than $n$.\nAlso, one can ask oneself  *How much is the system controllable?* - The answer to that question is coming from the properties of the controllability Gramian, since if $W_n$ is close to drop the rank, then the inverse is large and therefore it requires high efforts to control  the system.\n\nIt is important to remember that controllability guarantees the ability to transfer  the  initial state to the final one by some control input action over a finite time.  In addition to controllability, another notion used here is *reachability*. Reachability is defined as an ability of the system to be transferred from the origin to a desired state, while controllability is as an ability to transfer system from an arbitrary state to the origin. Reachability implies controllability, while controllability implies reachability when the state transition matrix $A^n$ is nonsingular.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Determining controllability\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Determine controllability of the following discrete system:\n   $$\\begin{array}{ccc} x_1(k+1)&=&ax_1(k)+bx_2(k)\\\\ x_2(k+1)&=&cx_1(k)+dx_2(k)+u(k)\\end{array}$$\n   with $ab-cd\\neq 0$.

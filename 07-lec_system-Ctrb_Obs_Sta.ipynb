Given the characteristic equation $\\Pi(z)=a_nz^n+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1}z+a_0$ from $\\Pi(z)=det(zI-\\Phi)$, one can substitute for $z=\\frac{1+w}{1-w}$ and obtain the corresponding $\\Pi(w)$ which then can be used by standard Routh array test which requires that for stability all coefficients in the Routh array must be positive.\n\nIn $Z$-domain, a relaxed LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if its poles of the transfer function $H(z)$ are inside the unit circle. This is a very efficient approach to check the stability of an LTI system. The result is illustrated in the following graph.\n\n![img](./FiguresCHE573/stability_radius2.png \"Stability radius\")\n\nIn CHE 446 Process Control, we learned that for continuous-time systems, if the poles of the Laplace transfer function of a system are on the left half plane of the complex $s$-plane, the system is stable. The difference between the results for continuous-time system and discrete-time systems actually can be explained by studying the relation between Laplace transform and $z$-transform.\n\nLet us recall the definition for Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of a continuous-time signal $x_c(t)$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$X_c(s) = \\int_{t=0}^{t=\\infty}x_c(t)e^{-st}dt$$\n\nThe $z$-transform of a discrete-time signal $x(n)$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x(n)z^{-n}$$\n\nLet us also consider that $x(n)$ is the sampled signal of $x_c(t)$ with the sampling time $T$. Then,\n\n$$x(n)=x_c(nT)$$\n\nSubstituting this discretization time back to, we can have:\n\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x_c(nT)z^{-n}$$\n\nBy comparing above equations, it can be seen that:\n\n$$X(z) = X_c(s)|_{t=nT}$$\n\nwith\n\n$$z=e^{sT}$$\n\nwe can interpret $z$-transform as the sampled Laplace transform with $z=e^{sT}$.\n\nLet us consider an area on the left half of the $s$-plane as shown in the following graph. The area is with the boundary $A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow C'\\rightarrow D\\rightarrow E'\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow A$. In the graph, $w_s=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{T}$ where $T$ is the sampling time. The points on the boundary are mapped to the $z$-plane as follows:\n\n-   Point A: $s=0$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{T\\cdot 0}=1$\n-   Point B: $s=i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{T\\cdot s}=\\cos(\\dfrac{Tw_s}{2})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{Tw_s}{2})=\\cos(\\pi)+i\\sin(\\pi)=-1$\n-   Point C: $s=-\\alpha+i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point C': $s=-\\alpha+i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{4}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{-T\\alpha}(\\cos(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}))=i\\cdot e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point D: $s=-\\alpha$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point E': $s=-\\alpha-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{4}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-i\\cdot e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point E: $s=-\\alpha-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-e^{-T\\alpha}$\n-   Point F: $s=-i\\cdot \\dfrac{w_s}{2}$ $\\rightarrow$ $z=-1$\n\nIt can be seen that the area in the $s$-plane is mapped into an annulus with outside radius $r_o=1$ and inside radius $r_i=e^{-T\\alpha}$. Similar analysis can be applied to other areas. What we should find is that the left half of the $s$-plane is mapped to the inside of the unit circle. This explains why in the discrete-time domain, the stability condition is poles are within the unit circle.\n\n![img](./FiguresCHE573/output-onlinepngtools-2.png \"Stability radius\")\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Summary\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":{"KEYWORDS":"Discrete system properties"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

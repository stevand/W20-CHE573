* Concept of Frequency in CT and DT Sinusoidal Signals

 - In this section, we will discuss the concept of frequency in continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) signals. Specifically, we will focus on CT sinusoidal and DT sinusoidal signals. The reason is that we could use a sum of several sinusoids of different amplitudes and frequencies to approximate many signals:

 \[x(t) \approx \sum\limits_{i=1}^NA_i\cos(2\pi F_i t + \theta_i).\]

 This implies that sinusoidal signals are the basics of general signals.

** Representation of CT sinusoids

 - A continuous-time sinusoid is mathematically described as follows:

 \[x_c(t) = A \cos(\Omega t + \theta),\; -\infty<t<\infty.\]

 - The subscript $c$ used with $x$ denotes a continuous-time signal. This signal is completely characterized by three parameters: $A$ is the \amplitude\ of the sinusoid; $\Omega$ is the \frequency\ in radian per second; $\theta$ is the {\em phase} in radians. An example is shown in Figure.

#+RESULTS: fig1

 - Instead of $\Omega$, we quite often use the frequency $F$ in cycles per second or hertz (Hz). The relationship between $\Omega$ and $F$ is as follows:

 \[\Omega = 2\pi F.\]

 - In terms of $F$, (\ref{eqn:l3_sin}) can be written as:

 \[x_c(t) = A \cos(2\pi F t + \theta),\; -\infty<t<\infty.\]

 Both above forms will be used.
